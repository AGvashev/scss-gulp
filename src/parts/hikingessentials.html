                <p class="hikingessentials__text">The nice thing about beginning hiking is that you don’t really need any special gear, you can probably get away with things you already have.
                    Let’s start with clothing. A typical mistake hiking beginners make is wearing jeans and regular clothes, which will get heavy and chafe wif they get sweaty or wet. </p>
